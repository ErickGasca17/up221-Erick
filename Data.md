## Data Set 1
Name: Urban Displacement Project 

Description: The Urban Displacement Project research aims to understand and describe the nature of gentrification, exclusion, and displacement. The goal of this research is to produce empowerment to advocates and policymakers to reframe conversations about how to prevent displacement. I believe this research data is useful for me since I want to map displacement in the community of Boyle Heights.

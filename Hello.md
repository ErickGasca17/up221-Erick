## About me
My Name is Erick Gasca Born and Raised in Boyle Heights.

I am the second child of migrant parents. Momma Bear from Guadalajara, Poppa Bear from Guanajuato.

## Hobbies 

I enjoy riding my motorcycle, due to the traffic congestion. I feel like Moses. 

Enjoy the outdoors and spending time with my dog. 
 

## Passion for Planning 
My passion for planning started during my undergrad at UCSC üçåüêå. 
I worked on a senior thesis focusing on Gentrification and historical displacement in underserved communities.
# Project Ideas
I want to produce maps of hostile planning architecture in public spaces, or I would like to map Light Rail Transit development and the connection with the displacement of long-term residents. If none of these work due to not enough data i would like to map "We buy homes for cash" signs.
